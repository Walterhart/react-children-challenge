# Avatar Component

This project implements an Avatar component in React, which was created as a part of a code challenge. The Avatar component allows you to render different types of avatars based on the provided props.

1. Image-based Avatar: An avatar with an image provided through the `src` prop and an optional `alt` text.

2. Initials Avatar: An avatar that displays the initials of the user as text. The initials are provided as children to the Avatar component.

3. Anonymous Avatar: An avatar that displays an anonymous icon, indicating an unknown user. This avatar is rendered when no image or initials are provided.
